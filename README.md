# Database Portfolio Piece



# Introduction

A database was designed for an organisation providing a premium service for viewing luxury properties for sale in the UK.

The ERD was drawn using Visual Paradigm. The SQL statements were written in Notepad++ and the database was implemented using SQL Lite. The report begins with the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which shows the relational database design. There are 7 entities: NNStaff, EstateAgents, Client, Vendor, Property, Viewing and Offers.

The assumptions for the entities and their relationships are explained after the diagram.

The sql statements to create the tables and to query the database are then shown. Sample data was added to the database to demonstrate its functionality.
