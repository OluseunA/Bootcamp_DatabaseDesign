# Computer Fundamentals Assignment



# Introduction

This report focuses on database design for J. Neuwmann and I. Noriss (NN), an organisation providing a premium service for viewing luxury properties for sale in the UK.

The ERD was drawn using Visual Paradigm. The SQL statements were written in Notepad++ and the database was implemented using SQL Lite. The report begins with the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which shows the relational database design. There are 7 entities: NNStaff, EstateAgents, Client, Vendor, Property, Viewing and Offers.

The assumptions for the entities and their relationships are explained after the diagram.

This is followed by the &#39;create table&#39; statements for each of the entities. This is followed by the insert statements, the queries and their results, followed by the conclusion. All the SQL code can be found in the appendix.
